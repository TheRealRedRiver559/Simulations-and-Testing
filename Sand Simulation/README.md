This is a sand simulation I have been slowly working on for some time. While I learn physics, I will keep adding features. 
At the moment the temperature is calculated using a guassiuan blur with a particle raduis of 5x5. This allows for a "close enough" heat transfer system for now. 
I will add more to this project as I continue learning or whenever I have time.

For example I could implement vectors and other very cool features, but I dont have the time to do this.
